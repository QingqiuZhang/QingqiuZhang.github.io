In this article, I will demonstrate how to an end-to-end machine learning project using diverse classification models. In case you need the source data, visit this webpage: Data Source What Can We Do With This Dataset? The observations in the dataset are all females from Pima Indian heritage who are greater than or equal to 21 years old. Data Preprocessing I cannot emphasize the importance of data preprocessing. It is the process of transforming raw data into more reasonable, useful and efficient format. It's a must and one of the most important step in a machine learing project. Without it our models will probably crash and won't be able to generate good results. There are several steps in data preprocessing: data cleaning, data reduction and data transformation. In the following paragraphs, I'll show you how to perform the steps one by one.

Shall we pop the champagne now? If we further examine the data, we will find that the situation is not as good as we thought. data.describe().round(2) count mean std min 25% 50% 75% max Pregnancies 768.0 3.85 3.37 0.00 1.00 3.00 6.00 17.00 Glucose 768.0 120.89 31.97 0.00 99.00 117.00 140.25 199.00 BloodPressure 768.0 69.11 19.36 0.00 62.00 72.00 80.00 122.00 SkinThickness 768.0 20.54 15.95 0.00 0.00 23.00 32.00 99.00 Insulin 768.0 79.80 115.24 0.00 0.00 30.50 127.25 846.00 BMI 768.0 31.99 7.88 0.00 27.30 32.00 36.60 67.10 DiabetesPedigreeFunction 768.0 0.47 0.33 0.08 0.24 0.37 0.63 2.42 Age 768.0 33.24 11.76 21.00 24.00 29.00 41.00 81.00 Outcome 768.0 0.35 0.48 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 1.00 We can see from the picture above that the minimum value of Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI is zero. However, anyone having common sense knows that by no means would these indicators of an alive person be zero. Apparently, the null values are replaced by zeros when inputing data. Here we calculate the number of null values in each column so that we will better decide how to deal with them. for col in list(data.columns): zero = len(data[data[col] == 0]) print('0s in %s: %d' % (col, zero)) 0s in Pregnancies: 111 0s in Glucose: 5 0s in BloodPressure: 35 0s in SkinThickness: 227 0s in Insulin: 374 0s in BMI: 11 0s in DiabetesPedigreeFunction: 0 0s in Age: 0 0s in Outcome: 500 There are nearly 400 null values in Insulin column, so it's not realistic to drop all the null values. Normally under such circumstance, we replace them with indicators such as mean, median, or mode, etc. Here I choose median. # replace 0s in target columns with null value data.iloc[:, 1:6] = data.iloc[:, 1:6].replace({0:np.NaN}) # fill null values with medians data = data.fillna(data.median()) data.describe().round(2).T count mean std min 25% 50% 75% max Pregnancies 768.0 3.85 3.37 0.00 1.00 3.00 6.00 17.00 Glucose 768.0 121.66 30.44 44.00 99.75 117.00 140.25 199.00 BloodPressure 768.0 72.39 12.10 24.00 64.00 72.00 80.00 122.00 SkinThickness 768.0 29.11 8.79 7.00 25.00 29.00 32.00 99.00 Insulin 768.0 140.67 86.38 14.00 121.50 125.00 127.25 846.00 BMI 768.0 32.46 6.88 18.20 27.50 32.30 36.60 67.10 DiabetesPedigreeFunction 768.0 0.47 0.33 0.08 0.24 0.37 0.63 2.42 Age 768.0 33.24 11.76 21.00 24.00 29.00 41.00 81.00 Outcome 768.0 0.35 0.48 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.00 1.00 Now we can visualize the dataset and see if we can find something else. import seaborn as sns sns.pairplot(data, hue=&quot;Outcome&quot;, corner=True) From the pairplot above, we discover this is an imbalanced dataset. There are 500 observations whose outcome is 0 and only 268 is 1. If we train our model with such data, the results may be misleading. There are several methods to deal with imbalanced data: Collect more data Under-Sampling Over-Sampling Use confusion matrix or other way to evaluate the peformance As the number of observations is only 768, it's unrealistic to under-sampling. Here I wil illustrate how to do oversampling using SMOTE(). from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE # get X, y X = data.iloc[:, 0:8] y = data.iloc[:, -1] # perform SMOTE() oversample = SMOTE() X, y = oversample.fit_resample(X, y) # join X, y y = pd.DataFrame(y) data = pd.concat([X, y], axis=1) print(data.shape) data.describe().round(2).T count mean std min 25% 50% 75% max Pregnancies 1000.0 3.99 3.33 0.00 1.00 3.00 6.00 17.00 Glucose 1000.0 126.40 31.39 44.00 102.82 122.00 148.00 199.00 BloodPressure 1000.0 72.97 11.71 24.00 65.75 72.00 80.00 122.00 SkinThickness 1000.0 29.64 8.22 7.00 27.00 29.00 33.00 99.00 Insulin 1000.0 146.58 90.69 14.00 125.00 125.00 136.25 846.00 BMI 1000.0 33.01 6.68 18.20 28.40 32.66 36.80 67.10 DiabetesPedigreeFunction 1000.0 0.49 0.32 0.08 0.26 0.40 0.65 2.42 Age 1000.0 33.88 11.34 21.00 25.00 31.00 41.00 81.00 Outcome 1000.0 0.50 0.50 0.00 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.00 Once again visualize the dataset to see the changes in the distribution of data. sns.pairplot(data, hue=&quot;Outcome&quot;, corner=True) For now, we transform the original imbalanced dataset into a balanced dataset with the number of each outcome class being 500. there is not much difference in distribution between diabetics and nondiabetics. Glucose should have the highest correlation with Outcome among all the features. We can testify it using a correlation matrix heatmap. corr_mat = data.corr().round(2) plt.figure(figsize = (15,10)) sns.heatmap(corr_mat, annot=True) Data Transformation If the range of two features differ a lot, for example, one is from 0 to 1 and the other is from 0 to 10,000, apparantly models won't treat such two features equally. Normally, the feature with larger range would influence the result more. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean it's more important than the other one. That's why we need scale the features. Frequently used scaling techniques are: MinMaxScaler() StardardScaler() MaxAbsScaler() RobustScaler() I usually choose MinMaxScaler() or StandardScaler() for most of datasets. You can also use others according to the charasteristic of the dataset at hand. # get X, y X = data.drop([&quot;Outcome&quot;], axis=1) y = data[&quot;Outcome&quot;] X2 = X.copy y2 = y.copy from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # split X, y into traning set and validation set X2_train, X2_trainValid, y2_train, y2_trainValid = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, stratify=y) # perform feature scaling scaler = StandardScaler() X2_train = scaler.fit_transform(X2_train) print(X2_train) X2_trainValid = scaler.transform(X2_trainValid) print(X2_trainValid) [[-0.86583338 -1.18590252 -2.5407598 ... 2.36236055 0.059368 -0.66182567] [-0.56074762 -1.30437961 -0.5856297 ... 0.92385297 1.5766631 -0.575063 ] [-0.56074762 -0.84741167 -1.01001675 ... 0.49700038 -0.09947556 -1.09563904] ...

Knowing these is useful to data reduction, for example, if a feature is highly correlated with the target, then we had better retain it. Or if two features are highly correlated, it would be much easier for us if we drop out one of them. Here I use PCA (Principal componenet analysis) for a demonstration. from sklearn.decomposition import PCA pca = PCA() X = pca.fit_transform(X) print(X) [[-1.48212827e+01 2.66418913e+01 6.77045733e+00 ... 1.28306645e+00 -4.41730071e-01 1.08702215e-01] [-2.53614440e+01 -3.80054541e+01 -1.53466357e+00 ... 4.06783776e+00 -2.50459441e+00 -9.57021831e-02] [-9.83659118e+00 5.72071616e+01 -1.78166537e+01 ... 8.30157785e+00 4.60163646e+00 2.42241723e-01] ...
