It is often seen as one of the most important step during a machine learning project. One must be patient with the data manimulation no matter how troublesome it is. In this article, we are finally exposed to the model traing procedure. I will demonstrate how to conduct different types of classification models and how to evalute their performance. In case you need the source data, visit this webpage: Data Source Model Training And Evaluating There are so many classification models. Some you may have heard or used while the others not. This articles covers almost all the classification models you may need as a beginner. I will show you how to conduct them and how different hyperparameters will affect the models.

The observations in the dataset are all females from Pima Indian heritage who are greater than or equal to 21 years old. Data Preprocessing I cannot emphasize the importance of data preprocessing. It is the process of transforming raw data into more reasonable, useful and efficient format. It's a must and one of the most important step in a machine learing project. Without it our models will probably crash and won't be able to generate good results. There are several steps in data preprocessing: data cleaning, data reduction and data transformation. In the following paragraphs, I'll show you how to perform the steps one by one. Data Cleaning # packages needed import numpy as np import pandas as pd # load data data = pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv') data.head(10) .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; font-size: 65%; } Pregnancies Glucose BloodPressure SkinThickness Insulin BMI DiabetesPedigreeFunction Age Outcome 0 6 148 72 35 0 33.6 0.627 50 1 1 1 85 66 29 0 26.6 0.351 31 0 2 8 183 64 0 0 23.3 0.672 32 1 3 1 89 66 23 94 28.1 0.167 21 0 4 0 137 40 35 168 43.1 2.288 33 1 5 5 116 74 0 0 25.6 0.201 30 0 6 3 78 50 32 88 31.0 0.248 26 1 7 10 115 0 0 0 35.3 0.134 29 0 8 2 197 70 45 543 30.5 0.158 53 1 9 8 125 96 0 0 0.0 0.232 54 1 The meaning of each column is stated as below: Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function Age: Age (years) Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) Next, we need to examin whether there are null values in the dataset. data.isnull().sum() It seems there is no null values. Shall we pop the champagne now? If we further examine the data, we will find that the situation is not as good as we thought. data.describe() We can see from the picture above that the minimum value of Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI is zero. However, anyone having common sense knows that by no means would these indicators of an alive person be zero. Apparently, the null values are replaced by zeros when inputing data. Here we calculate the number of null values in each column so that we will better decide how to deal with them. for col in list(data.columns): zero = len(data[data[col] == 0]) print('0s in %s: %d' % (col, zero)) There are nearly 400 null values in Insulin column, so it's not realistic to drop all the null values. Normally under such circumstance, we replace them with indicators such as mean, median, or mode, etc. Here I choose median. # replace 0s in target columns with null value data.iloc[:, 1:6] = data.iloc[:, 1:6].replace({0:np.NaN}) # fill null values with medians data = data.fillna(data.median()) data.describe() Data Transformation If the range of two features differ a lot, for example, one is from 0 to 1 and the other is from 0 to 10,000, apparantly models won't treat such two features equally. Normally, the feature with larger range would influence the result more. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean it's more important than the other one. That's why we need scale the features. Frequently used scaling techniques are: MinMaxScaler() StardardScaler() MaxAbsScaler() RobustScaler() I usually choose MinMaxScaler() or StandardScaler() for most of datasets. You can also use others according to the charasteristic of the dataset at hand. # get X, y X = data.drop([&quot;Outcome&quot;], axis=1) y = data[&quot;Outcome&quot;] X2 = X.copy y2 = y.copy from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # split X, y into traning set and validation set X2_train, X2_trainValid, y2_train, y2_trainValid = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, stratify=y) # perform feature scaling scaler = StandardScaler() X2_train = scaler.fit_transform(X2_train) print(X2_train) X2_trainValid = scaler.transform(X2_trainValid) print(X2_trainValid) Data Reduction With clean data at hand, we can visulize the data, which may indicate some relations between the features or between features and targets. Knowing these is useful to data reduction, for example, if a feature is highly correlated with the target, then we had better retain it. Or if two features are highly correlated, it would be much easier for us if we drop out one of them. Here I use PCA (Principal componenet analysis) for a demonstration. import seaborn as sns sns.pairplot(data, hue=&quot;Outcome&quot;, corner=True) From the pair plot above, we see that there is not much difference in distribution between diabetics and nondiabetics except glucose. We can further test it by calculating the correlation matrix. corr_mat = data.corr().round(2) corr_mat We can see the result more easily visualizing the correlation matrix. sns.heatmap(corr_mat) ","link":"https://qingqiuzhang.github.io/diabetes-dataset-report/"}]}
